# Secure-Cloud-Password-Manager
Configure Password Manager on AWS Cloud

## Introduction

As a cybersecurity specialist, I know how critical password management security is for individuals and companies in today's digital era. Maintaining data security and integrity requires robust password management solutions because of the growing complexity and number of online accounts. In this tutorial, I'll walk you through setting up a Password Manager solution in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud environment. Leveraging AWS's scalable infrastructure and security capabilities can ensure  the security of the critical credentials stored and managed. I'll provide thorough, step-by-step directions to set up and configure a Password Manager solution. I'll use AWS to improve password security and streamline credential management procedures.

## Understanding Password Managers

Before we dive in, it's essential to understand the concept of password managers. Password managers are software applications designed to handle and securely store passwords for various online accounts. They offer a centralized vault where all passwords are kept under one master password, reducing the stress of remembering numerous complicated passwords. They also enhance user convenience and security with features like password generation, autofill, and cross-device synchronization.

## Requirements
Below are the requirements for the setup procedure;
- AWS account
- VirtualBox/Ubuntu/Kali operating systems
- Namecheap Domain
- Passbolt

## Getting Started
### Passbolt Password Manager Setup on AWS
To get started with setting up Passbolt Password Manager on AWS, I followed these steps:

- Create and Configure an EC2 Instance
- Launch an EC2 instance from the AWS Management Console.
- Choose an appropriate instance type and configure the security group to allow necessary ports.
- SSH into your EC2 instance using the provided key pair.
